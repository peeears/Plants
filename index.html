              The plant was cultivated in Yemen around 1000 AD, and later it
              spread around the world. It’s a widespread plant - but not
              literally: the bushes are regularly pruned because smaller plants
              are easier to harvest. Some 33 species can be found in Africa, 14
              species in Madagascar and 3 species in South-East Asia and
              Mauritius. Arabica is the most flavoursome coffee variety and is
              used for no less than three-quarters of total global coffee
              production.

              Popular since Victorian times, this was a plant commonly found
              growing in home Parlors (and that's how it got its common name).
              The Parlor was often considered the best room in the house and
              somewhere important guests would be entertained. Looking back it
              makes perfect sense that the Victorian's would only try and grow
              the most hardy and robust looking plants. For minimal care and
              effort they'd be rewarded with a room enhancing plant.

              The first European known to have sighted Norfolk Island was
              Captain James Cook. In 1774, on his second voyage to the South
              Pacific in HMS Resolution, Cook noted the presence of large
              forests of tall, straight trees that appeared to be suitable for
              use as masts and yards for sailing ships. However, when the island
              was occupied in 1788 by convicts transported from Britain, it was
              found that Norfolk Island pine trees were not resilient enough for
              those uses and the industry was abandoned

              In the wild Dracaena grows well in Africa and adjacent islands
              such as Madeira, the Canary Islands, and the Cape Verde Islands,
              although there are also a couple of species in southern Asia and
              one in Central America. There are varieties which definitely look
              like a tree with a trunk, but there are also robust bush shapes.
              They can reach a ripe old age, and some species develop a very
              unusual shape in the wild that look positively primeval. The plant
              has been around in the West since 1752 and has been popular as a
              houseplant since 1880.

              the 1940s discovery of dawn redwood (Shuishan , Metasequoia
              glyptostroboides) in the construction of a modern Chinese national
              identity, as manifested in Chinese intellectual and popular
              discourse from the second half of the twentieth century to the
              present day. As the shuishan was transformed from a distinct
              biological species into an iconic national species, modern China
              as an ‘imagined community’ was forged in three dimensions

              To the Chinese people, the dawn redwood is second only to the
              panda as a conservation icon. Thought to have been extinct for
              millions of years, a Save the Redwoods League group discovered
              that this unusual member of the redwood family still exists in
              China, shedding its leaves in the fall.

              This mutation was discovered in a shipment of N. exaltata to
              Boston from Philadelphia in 1894.[2] Other proposals for the
              origin of the term Boston fern were documented by David Fairchild,

              Soar, who sent the plants to his friend in Boston.[3]
